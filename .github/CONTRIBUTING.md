## Contribution Policy

Initially, Litestream was closed to outside contributions. The goal was to
reduce burnout by limiting the maintenance overhead of reviewing and validating
third-party code. However, this policy is overly broad and has prevented small,
easily testable patches from being contributed.

Litestream is now open to code contributions for bug fixes only. Features carry
a long-term maintenance burden so they will not be accepted at this time.
Please [submit an issue][new-issue] if you have a feature you'd like to
request.

If you find mistakes in the documentation, please submit a fix to the
[documentation repository][docs].
