==========

Litestream is a standalone disaster recovery tool for SQLite. It runs as a
background process and safely replicates changes incrementally to another file
or S3. Litestream only communicates with SQLite through the SQLite API so it
will not corrupt your database.

If you need support or have ideas for improving Litestream, please join the
[Litestream Slack][slack] or visit the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions).
Please visit the [Litestream web site](https://litestream.io) for installation
instructions and documentation.

If you find this project interesting, please consider starring the project on

## Acknowledgements

While the Litestream project does not accept external code patches, many
of the most valuable contributions are in the forms of testing, feedback, and
documentation. These help harden software and streamline usage for other users.

I want to give special thanks to individuals who invest much of their time and 
energy into the project to help make it better:

- Thanks to [Cory LaNou](https://twitter.com/corylanou) for giving early feedback and testing when Litestream was still pre-release.
- Thanks to [Michael Lynch](https://github.com/mtlynch) for digging into issues and contributing to the documentation.
- Thanks to [Kurt Mackey](https://twitter.com/mrkurt) for feedback and testing.
- Thanks to [Sam Weston](https://twitter.com/cablespaghetti) for figuring out how to run Litestream on Kubernetes and writing up the docs for it.
- Thanks to [Rafael](https://github.com/netstx) & [Jungle Boogie](https://github.com/jungle-boogie) for helping to get OpenBSD release builds working.
- Thanks to [Simon Gottschlag](https://github.com/simongottschlag), [Marin](https://github.com/supermarin),[Victor Bj√∂rklund](https://github.com/victorbjorklund), [Jonathan Beri](https://twitter.com/beriberikix) [Yuri](https://github.com/yurivish), [Nathan Probst](https://github.com/nprbst), [Yann Coleu](https://github.com/yanc0), and [Nicholas Grilly](https://twitter.com/ngrilly) for frequent feedback, testing, & support.

## Contribution Policy

Initially, Litestream was closed to outside contributions. The goal was to
reduce burnout by limiting the maintenance overhead of reviewing and validating
third-party code. However, this policy is overly broad and has prevented small,
easily testable patches from being contributed.

Litestream is now open to code contributions for bug fixes only. Features carry
a long-term maintenance burden so they will not be accepted at this time.
Please [submit an issue][new-issue] if you have a feature you'd like to
request.

If you find mistakes in the documentation, please submit a fix to the
[documentation repository][docs].
