==========

Litestream is a standalone disaster recovery tool for SQLite. It runs as a
background process and safely replicates changes incrementally to another file
or S3. Litestream only communicates with SQLite through the SQLite API so it
will not corrupt your database.

If you need support or have ideas for improving Litestream, please join the
[Litestream Slack][slack] or visit the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream/discussions).
Please visit the [Litestream web site](https://litestream.io) for installation
instructions and documentation.
