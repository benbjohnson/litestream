# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in Litestream, please report it responsibly.

**Please DO NOT open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security issues via email to the maintainers. This allows us to assess the issue and release a fix before the vulnerability is publicly disclosed.

## What to Include

When reporting a security issue, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

## Response Timeline

We will make our best effort to acknowledge receipt of your report as soon as possible and keep you informed of our progress. Please understand that as an open source project, response times may vary.

Thank you for helping keep Litestream and its users safe!
